## Description

This refactor was done to provide Horiseon's website the ability to support all types of users, specifically those that are differently abled. It really allowed me to learn about semantic naming to make an HTML page more searchable and more accessible. I did not know about the "aside" element tag before, nor did I realize that HTML pages are broken into heads and bodys - with header, sections and footers as part of the body. I appreciated the fact that I needed to reorder the HTML to have a more logical flow with respect to its programmatic elements, making it easier to navigate the CSS as the element tags were in the same order as the CSS adjustments. The "alt" property was helpful and really a challenge to design since I needed to develop an accurate written description for each image. I also learned the value of testing everything on the page since a link was broken and I did not notice until I clicked all the links on the page.
